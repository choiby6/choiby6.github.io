    <h2>Advanced Analytics</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why teams use advanced analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Advanced stats are mostly about context and comparison. MLB teams have to compare players across
        different ballparks, different eras, and different roles. That’s why “adjusted” stats (like OPS+)
        and “all-in-one value” stats (like WAR) are common in front offices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scouts still matter a lot, but analytics helps teams make consistent decisions for drafting, trades,
        free agency, and roster construction by combining many data points into a clearer picture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What is WAR?</h3>
      <p>
        WAR (Wins Above Replacement) estimates a player’s total value in wins compared to a replacement-level
        player. It rolls offense, defense, and baserunning (and for pitchers, run prevention) into one number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams like WAR because it gives a quick “overall value” snapshot and allows easier comparisons
        across positions. The important thing to remember is that WAR is an estimate, not a perfect truth,
        and the exact value can differ depending on the model used.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>OPS+</h3>
      <p>
        OPS+ adjusts a player’s OPS for park and league effects; 100 is league average, above 100 is better than average.
        Teams like it because raw hitting numbers can be misleading in hitter-friendly or pitcher-friendly parks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In plain terms, OPS+ helps answer: “How good was this hitter compared to the league, once we adjust for context?”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Great historical examples (high level)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall value (WAR):</strong> Babe Ruth and Willie Mays are classic all-around benchmarks.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern all-around value:</strong> Mike Trout is often cited as a standout modern WAR example.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusted hitting (OPS+):</strong> Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, and Barry Bonds are commonly cited as elite levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These examples are meant as recognizable references. Comparing across eras is tricky, which is exactly
        why adjusted stats exist in the first place.
