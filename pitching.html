    <h2>Pitching Statistics</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Core Metrics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ERA</strong> = (Earned Runs × 9) ÷ Innings Pitched</li>
        <li><strong>WHIP</strong> = (Walks + Hits) ÷ Innings Pitched</li>
        <li><strong>K%</strong> = Strikeouts ÷ Batters Faced</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why teams value pitching stats</h3>
      <p>
        The main job of a pitcher is run prevention, and ERA is the most common summary of that.
        But teams also look deeper to understand how a pitcher gets results and whether those results
        are likely to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHIP shows how much traffic a pitcher allows. K% is popular because strikeouts remove randomness:
        no ball in play means less dependence on defense and fewer “lucky” hits. In general, pitchers who
        limit baserunners and miss bats are safer bets.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>How scouts evaluate pitchers beyond the box score</h3>
      <p>
        Scouts connect the stats to tools: velocity, movement, command, pitch mix, and deception.
        A high K% often suggests a real “out pitch.” A low WHIP often points to command and the ability
        to avoid free passes and hard contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scouts also consider context like ballpark, defense behind the pitcher, opponent quality, and workload.
        A pitcher can get very different results depending on the team and environment.

      <h3>Great historical examples (high level)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strikeout dominance:</strong> Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson are famous examples.</li>
        <li><strong>Elite peak run prevention:</strong> Pedro Martínez is often cited as a standout peak performer.</li>
        <li><strong>Command and efficiency:</strong> Greg Maddux is a classic example of elite control and pitching craft.</li>
        <li><strong>Relief dominance:</strong> Mariano Rivera is often cited for historic consistency and run prevention.</li>
